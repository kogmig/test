# NewEgg Marketplace SDK for .Net

Newegg Marketplace SDK(C#) is a library to help .Net programmers easily integrate their application with the Newegg Marketplace API.  Included are definitions for the data objects models to create the request and resolve the response. The logger and retry mechanism can be customized to your requirements.

To use the SDK to communicate with the Newegg API, you need to be a registered seller and have an 'Authorization' and 'Secret Key' by . Put this information into a JSON file and load the setting using the APIConfig.FromJsonFile method. Without the 'API Key' and 'Secret Key' you can run the test project in Simulation Mode.  This is provided to help you understand the SDK before actual use.

The solution contains 2 library projects: Newegg.Marketplace.SDK.Base and Newegg.Marketplace.SDK. The first one is the framework of the SDK, and the second one is the business logic model and interface to various API. The code is based on .NET Standard 2.0, you can build it with .Net framework 4.6 or .Net Core 2.1.


## Target Frameworks

* .NET Core 2.1 
* .NET Framework 4.6 

## Installation

## Q&A
- How to use the SDK?
1. We recommed setting these infomation in a json file as below. 
```json
{    
  "SellerID": "****",
  "Credentials": {
    "Authorization": "********************************",
    "SecretKey": "*******-****-****-****-************"
  },
  "Connection": {
    "RequestTimeoutMs": 30000,
    "AttemptsTimes": 5,
    "RetryIntervalMs": 1000
  },
  "APIFormat": "XML",
  "Platform": "CAN"
}
```

2. load the configuration to a APIConfig object.
```csharp
APIConfig config = APIConfig.FromJsonFile(PathOfTheJSONConfigFile);
```
3. Create a APIClient with the config.
```csharp
APIClient client = new APIClient(config);
```
4. Create the APICall object with the APIClien.
```csharp
OrderCall ordercall = new OrderCall(client);
```
5. Use the APICall object to call API.
```csharp
var orderstatus = await ordercall.GetOrderStatus("105137040", 304);
```    

- What's the settings in the Config?
    * SellerID :  The 4-character Seller ID. Required.
    * Credentials.Authorization: The API Key get from datafeeds@newegg.com. Required.
    * Credentials.SecretKey: The Secret Key get from datafeeds@newegg.com. Required.
    * Connection.RequestTimeoutMs: The number of milliseconds the system connection timed out. Optional, Default:
    * Connection.AttemptsTimes: Number of retries after a failed connection. Optional, Default:
    * Connection.RetryIntervalMs: The number of milliseconds between retry attempts. Optional, Default:
    * BaseUrl: The base url of the Newegg marketplace API. Optional, Default: https://apis.newegg.com/marketplace/
    * APIFormat: Content type used to call API.  The options are XML and Json. Optional, Default: XML.

There is a Connection section in the config json file.
It contains the setting of 
  * RequestTimeoutMsï¼šMicroseconds count before throw the time out exception.
  * AttemptsTimes: Retry times
  * RetryIntervalMs: Microseconds count of the interval to retry.
  
```json
{
  "SellerID": "****",
  "Credentials": {
    "Authorization": "********************************",
    "SecretKey": "*******-****-****-****-************"
  },
  "Connection": {
    "RequestTimeoutMs": 30000,
    "AttemptsTimes": 5,
    "RetryIntervalMs": 1000
  },
  "APIFormat": "XML",
  "Platform": "CAN"
}
```
